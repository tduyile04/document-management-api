### Introduction

The Document Management API is a document management api that opens up access to manage user, user roles and documents management. It provides an authentication middleware to restrict access to certain endpoints to protect privacy and enhance information security.


### Technologies Used

JavaScript (ES6)
Node.js
Express
Postgresql
Sequelize ORM.
Local Development

### Prerequisites includes

- [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/) and
-  [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) >= v8.0.0.

### Project Dependencies

### Dependencies

**babel-cli** - Allows running the app in ES6 mode on the fly without having to transpile down to ES5

**babel-preset-es2015, babel-preset-stage-0** - These packages provide Babel presets for es2015 plugins, stage 0 plugins

**bcryptjs** - Used to hash passwords

**body-parser** - Node.js body parsing middleware. Parse incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, available under the req.body property.

**dotenv** - Loads environment variables

**express** - Used as the web server for this application

**express-validator** - Validates input on request body, params and query

**jsonwebtoken** - Generates JWT tokens and can verify them

**pg** - Non-blocking PostgreSQL client for node.js. Pure JavaScript and optional native libpq bindings

**pg-hstore** - A node package for serializing and deserializing JSON data to hstore format

**sequelize** - Sequelize is a promise-based Node.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server. It features solid transaction support, relations, read replication and more

**sequelize-cli** - The Sequelize Command Line Interface (CLI)
etc.


### Development Dependencies

**chai** - Chai is a BDD / TDD assertion library for node and the browser that can be delightfully paired with any javascript testing framework.

**coveralls** - Coveralls.io support for node.js. Get the great coverage reporting of coveralls.io and add a cool coverage button to your README.

**gulp** - gulp is a toolkit that helps you automate painful or time-consuming tasks in your development workflow.

**gulp-babel** - Use next generation JavaScript, today, with Babel

**gulp-exit** - ensures that the task is terminated after finishing.

**gulp-inject-modules** - Loads JavaScript files on-demand from a Gulp stream into Node's module loader.

**gulp-istanbul** - Istanbul unit test coverage plugin for gulp.

**gulp-shell** - A handy command line interface for gulp

**gulp-nodemon** - it's gulp + nodemon + convenience

**mocha** - A basic testing framework

**supertest** - HTTP assertions made easy via superagent.
etc.

### Installation and Setup

Clone this repository locally
Move into the project directory
Install project dependencies npm install
Create Postgresql database and run migrations.
Populate database with seed data
Start the express server npm start.
Run test npm test-server.

### Authentication

Users are assigned a token when signup or signin. This token is then used for subsequent HTTP requests to the API for authentication and should be sent as one of the header values.
